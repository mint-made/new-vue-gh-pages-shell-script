### Project Setup

1. Clone the project and make the script exectuable
2. Create a new Github repository for your project
3. Run the script in the directory you want to create your new project
4. Enter the project name (should be the same as the Github repository name)
5. Enter your Github credentials, when prompted by the terminal
6. When finished the script will open your project in VS Code if you have it installed
